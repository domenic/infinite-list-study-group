# Infinite List Study Group

The [layered web APIs](https://github.com/drufball/layered-apis) project envisions building high-level features into the browser. The first, hero feature for layered APIs is some sort of innite list, or infinite scrolling view, component.

This repository hosts a "study group" dedicated to exploring infinite list implementations in various ecosystems, both on the web an elsewhere. This will help us eventually design the infinite list layered API.
