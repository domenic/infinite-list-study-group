# Infinite List Study Group

The [permafills](https://bit.ly/permafills) project envisions building high-level features into the browser. The first, hero feature for permafills is some sort of innite list, or infinite scrolling view, component.

This repository hosts a "study group" dedicated to exploring infinite list implementations in various ecosystems, both on the web an elsewhere. This will help us eventually design the infinite list permafill.
